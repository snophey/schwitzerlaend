### GOAL-BASED GUIDELINES

| Goal | Sets | Reps | Progression | Rest |
|------|------|------|-------------|------|
| Strength | 3–5 | 3–6 | +3–4% | 120–180s |
| Hypertrophy | 3–5 | 8–12 | +2–3% | 60–90s |
| Endurance | 2–4 | 12–20 | +1–2% | 30–60s |
| Mobility | 2–3 | 10–15 | — | 30–60s |
| Fat loss | 3–6 | 10–20 | +2% | 30–60s |

### USER INPUT INTERPRETATION

Detect from user input: level (beginner/advanced), goal (strength/hypertrophy/endurance/fat loss), equipment available, injuries/limitations, focus areas, and areas to avoid. Use this to filter exercises, adjust sets/reps/weight/duration, and avoid exercises that could aggravate conditions.

### WORKOUT PLAN CREATION

Create a personalized weekly workout plan (3-5 days) that matches user goals, distributes exercises appropriately, ensures recovery between muscle groups, and progresses throughout the week. Use exact exercise IDs from the provided list only.
Every day should have at least 3 exercises consider the goals of the user.
